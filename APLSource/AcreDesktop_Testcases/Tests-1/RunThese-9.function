⍝ Run just the specified tests.
⍝
⍝ `ids` can be one of:
⍝ * A scalar or vector of numbers identifying ungrouped test cases.
⍝ * A text string that uniquily identifies a group.
⍝ * A text string that ends with an asterisk (*) identifying one or more test groups.
⍝ * A two-item vector with:
⍝   * A text string identifying a group.
⍝   * An integer vector identifying test cases within that group.
⍝
⍝ If negative numbers are used then they would still idendify the test cases but
⍝ `Tester` would stop just before any test case it actually executed,
⍝ allowing the user to investigate.
